### Lab Duration: 20 minutes

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to give students a basic introduction to administering an OpenStack cloud. Although you install each OpenStack service separately, the OpenStack services work together to meet your cloud needs: Identity, Compute, Image service, Block Storage, Networking (neutron), Object Storage, Orchestration, and Telemetry. These services may be distributed or local to one another, but in all instances, after you have authenticated yourself through Identity (keystone), you use OpenStack APIs to create and admin OpenStack cloud resources.

#### 1. Servers and Nova Services

Using some basic CLI tools can help give you a sense of the shape of your OpenStack cloud; number of servers, the health of each server (Up / Down), and what services are running where.

1. SSH to your controller, log in as root (this was covered in lab 00), and then issue the following command. 

    `[root@controller]#` `nova-manage service list | sort`

2. Look at the host names (to the left of .localdomain) to answer the following questions. We want a clear picture of the lab environment in your head, so ask the instructor if that picture is not crystal clear.
 
    - Q1: How many compute servers are running?
      - A1: Two compute servers running (compute1 and compute2)
    - Q2 Where are the compute servers running?
    - Q3 How many OpenStack cloud controllers are running?
    - Q4 What is the current state of all of your services?
     
    > A1 Two compute servers running  (compute1 and compute2)
    > A2 compute1.localdomain and compute2.localdomain  
    > A3 One cloud controller (controller.localdomain) 
    > A4 State of :-) means the service is up and running, whereas XXX means the service is no longer available.  

#### 2. Checking OpenStack Version

1. Return to your home directory, and then source the `keystonerc_admin` file. We will discuss what this file does in subsequent lessons. For right now, understand that it is a way to set what user is interacting with OpenStack at the CLI.

    `[root@controller]#` `cd`
	
	`[root@controller]#` `source keystonerc_admin`

    > This command will be explained in lab coming up, for right now, just know it has to do with setting proper permissions within the bash shell; a shortcut that tells the OpenStack cloud that we are the user admin. Your CLI prompt will also change

2. Display the service catalog for the OpenStack admin

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `keystone catalog | less`
	
    > For students who do not have much experience using the less command:
    >
    > Press q to quit Less utility and return to the CLI
    > Press CTRL + F to go forward one window, and CTRL + B to go back one window
    > Press CTRL + D to go forward one half window, and CTRL + U to go back one half window
    > If you have never used the less utility, you might find the following cheat sheet useful (http://sheet.shiar.nl/less)
 
3. Answer the following questions:

    - Q1 What IP address are these services being served from? 
    - Q2 Whose IP address is this? 
    - Q3 How are they different?
    - Q4 What are the names of the services currently in operation?
    
    > A1 192.168.0.10 /n
    > A2 The controller node
    > A3 Each has a unique port, which represents the API endpoint of a unique service
    > A4 Compute, network, Volume(v2), Compute(v3), s3, image, metering, volume, ec2, object store, identiy

4. List the nova service endpoints, does this output look familiar? 

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova service-list`

5. Collect the various version releases of your OpenStack services by issuing the following commands. What will be displayed is the release date of each service.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `keystone-manage --version`

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova-manage --version`

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `glance-manage --version`

6. Let's correlate the release date to our version. Navigate in browser to: [OpenStack Releases](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Releases)

7. Look over the chart and notice that the version of Kilo is the same version that was being displayed each time you issued the `[$SERVICE]-manage --version` command.

 * OpenStack is a project with ambitious release dates. Take a minute to read over the notes concerning how the project is maintained.
 
8. That's it for this lab!
